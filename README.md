A program for keeping track of which row you are on. First made for keeping track of knitting charts, but can also work with cross stitch patterns, weaving drafts, and more

Installation directions for non-programmers:

  See the "How to Download Program File" pdf for how to download the jar file

  Download the .jar file and run it (kind of like you would a .exe for installing other programs).
  You may need to download the latest Java JDK for the program to run (kind of like how you might need to download a program to read a pdf), you can find JDK 20 here:       https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk20-windows
